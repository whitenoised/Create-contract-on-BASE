# Base Mainnet Hello World Smart Contract

This project deploys a simple smart contract to the **Base Mainnet** that stores and returns the message "Hello World". The contract is optimized for minimal gas usage, with deployment costs typically around 0.00003 ETH (depending on gas prices). The deployment script uses Python with `web3.py` and connects to the Base Mainnet via an Infura API endpoint.
